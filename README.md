# Performance Profiling of the Chia Blockchain

This project was developed as part of the course **CS554 - Data-Intensive Computing** (Spring 2025, Illinois Institute of Technology).

It provides a complete benchmarking and performance analysis framework for the Chia blockchain's plotting process. The objective is to evaluate how key system parametersâ€”such as thread count, number of buckets, memory usage, and compression levelsâ€”impact the performance of different plotting phases and resource utilization.

## Project Structure

### Directories
- `logs/`: Contains raw output logs from Chia plotter runs, parsed JSON files with phase and table timing, and CSV files capturing system resource metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
- `plot/`: 
  - `final/`: Stores finalized plot files.
  - `temp/`: Stores temporary files generated during the plotting process.

### Scripts
- `benchmark_run.py`: Automates Chia plot creation over a grid of configurations (threads, buckets, compression levels).
- `benchmark_log_parser.py`: Parses Chia plotter logs and extracts structured timing data in JSON format.
- `benchmark_chia_plot.py`: Coordinates plotting execution and system resource monitoring.
- `benchmark_visualization.py`: Generates visualizations from parsed JSON and CSV files, including phase-by-phase timings and resource usage plots.

## Key Findings

Through empirical testing on $k=28$ and $k=32$ plots using the `chiapos` plotter, the following insights were observed:
- **Phase 1** is highly CPU-bound and sensitive to thread count. Increasing threads significantly reduces execution time for this phase.
- **Phase 3** is impacted by the number of buckets, with more buckets improving sorting efficiency and reducing runtime, especially on larger $k=32$ plots.
- Resource usage trends confirmed that disk throughput and memory behavior vary significantly across phases, depending on configuration.
- Compression levels (evaluated externally) trade off final plot size with compute requirements, and GPU-accelerated plotting (e.g., Bladebit CUDA) maintains stable performance up to moderate compression levels.

A detailed analysis of all benchmarks, methodology, and results is available in the final report:
